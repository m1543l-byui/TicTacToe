# Overview

The goal for this project was to learn C++ and demonstrate what I learned through implementation.
The implementation took for in a game of Tic Tac Toe as it includes a vast amount of concepts I learned.
Concepts range from: Utilizing correct Syntax, Input/Output, Arrays, Loops.
I hope that someone might find this code useful in seeing how all those concepts can make something simple and neat.
